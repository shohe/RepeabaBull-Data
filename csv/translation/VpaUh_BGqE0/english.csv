You pulled me, saying you wanted to see the stars
At once, I placed the moonlight in my eyes
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
I won’t leave you alone
Don’t let that moon get lonely
You pulled my hand, saying you wanted to see the stars
We sat on the rooftop at sunset
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
It’s alright, you’re my universe, shine bright for me
If these words in this song
Can comfort you, I’ll grab a pen
Instead of provoking words
I’ll say with genuine words,
all day
like a puppy rather than a cat
you waited for me (like.. ↑)
Why were you so sad all day?
You’re the most special on this star
I’m sure you didn’t even know
You want some more
Why do you try to lock yourself up?
You want some more
Sky is nothing to believe
You pulled my hand, saying you wanted to see the stars
We sat on the rooftop at sunset
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
It’s alright, you’re my universe, shine bright for me
Hey, sometimes
When you act all heavy
I can’t figure out how to comfort you
Like a lost star
You’re the one who pulls me
You’re floating around like a sky that lost its star
The path we took is like a constellation
Let’s follow that path
Remember me
You want some more
Why do you try to lock yourself up?
You want some more
Sky is nothing to believe
You pulled my hand, saying you wanted to see the stars
We sat on the rooftop at sunset
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
It’s alright, you’re my universe, shine bright for me
Girl I don’t know why I’m leaving
Girl I don’t know why,
tell me again from the beginning
Girl I don’t know why I’m leaving
Girl I don’t know why
You pulled my hand, saying you wanted to see the stars
We sat on the rooftop at sunset
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
It’s alright, you’re my universe, shine bright for me
I tried to look for something like you
I tried to pull you
Every time I look up in the sky
There’s not a single star
It’s alright, you’re my universe, shine bright for me
